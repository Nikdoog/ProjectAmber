       <p><b>Object:</b> The object of the game is to grow and develop your kingdom according to your preferences and cooperate with other kingdoms in helping each other out with their shortcomings through trade. In other words, think of this as a social collecting game.</p>
       <p><b>Equipment:</b> Players will develop the following  stats and resources through decrees and trade.</p>
	

<p><b>Setup:</b> Upon creation of an account, a player will select their Kingdom’s name and start out with being given three decrees for free. They will help better shape your kingdom based on how you would want to run it. </p>

<p><b>Decrees:</b> Decrees are decisions that you can make for your kingdom upon a specific issue that your country is dealing with. You will be asked to choose one of two or more answers on how you want to respond to an issue. You can aid or harm your country in various ways.  Do not worry, there are no wrong answers because your game objective is wholly determined by you. 

<p><b>Stats:</b> Your economy, culture, morale, will all be various stats that will either rise or fall depending on your choices in your decrees. The economy is arguably the most important one as it decides how efficiently your country can generate wealth.

<p><b>Trading:</b> You are free to message other kingdoms in attempts to make a trade offer. This is especially encouraged under two circumstances: to help cover your shortcomings with the aid of a country that specializes in a resource you do not, or to simply help out your friends. That being said, you are free to trade to any player for any reason. 

<p><b>Messaging:</b> The nature of this game is social and you can look up other Kingdoms and send them messages: whether it be to offer trades or simply to chat and ask for strategies to get ahead. The choice is yours.
